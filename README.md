Summary
===========

  non·de·script: adjective
  1. lacking distinctive or interesting features or characteristics.

This language is intended to operate and appear in such a way that it blends into one's mind. Writing it should not feel like writing code, but rather like talking to the computer as you would a person, telling it what to do in a natural feeling way (for engish speakers at least!). It does come across as slightly more verbose and some choices for its syntax and grammar may seem strange, but too bad! If it feels nice to write, then mission accomplished.
